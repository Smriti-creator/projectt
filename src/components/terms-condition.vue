            <p>
              It is your responsibility to ensure that there is no material
              difference between the Internship details that are advertised on
              Internalaya and the details that are communicated to Applicants
              later in the selection process (pre-interview, in offer letter
              etc.). Any ‘negative&#39; material difference (such as offered
              stipend being lower than what was advertised) will result in
              suitable action being taken by NIF against you.

          <li>
            <p>
              Any assignment(s) that you may give to Applicants to assess their
              suitability for the Internship should be fair and relevant to the
              Internship profile. Any attempt to get work done for free from
              Applicants disguised as assessment or to get them to download or
              generate downloads for your app or get likes/shares/comments etc.
              for your social media handles only for the purpose of getting free
              publicity disguised as an assignment are strictly prohibited and
              would invite suitable actions against you.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>

              obscene or offensive content.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Once you hire any Applicant(s) for your Internship, you must
              provide them with an offer letter clearly detailing all the
              important details of the Internship (such as role &amp;
              responsibilities, remuneration, and payment mechanism) and
              complete address and contact details of your organization.

          <li>

              You must pay the promised remuneration to the selected Applicants
              in a timely manner as per agreed terms and conditions in the offer
              letter. Non-payment of the remuneration or delayed payment of the
              remuneration is strictly prohibited and would invite suitable
              action against you.

              complaint(s) regarding the Internship that we may bring to your
              notice. Failure to do so may result in a temporary or permanent
              suspension of your Internalaya account depending on nature of the
              complaint.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you come across any suspicious activity, content or behaviour
              on Internalaya by an Applicant or another user, you must report it

              Internship, solely for the purpose of hiring. Any attempt to send

              You are strictly prohibited from transferring/selling/sharing
              Applicants&#39; data, for free or for a fee, to any other entity.
              Any such attempt would cause your Internalaya account being
              permanently blocked and it would result in legal action taken
              against you and your organization.
            </p>

        <h2>Terms for applicants</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms, specifically for Applicants, are in addition to the other
          Terms listed on the page that are common to all the users of the site,
          which you too are required to go through. Any violation of these Terms
          may result in, but not limited to, an applicant&#39;s Internship
          application being declined and/or his/her account being permanently
          blocked and/or suitable legal action being initiated against him/her
          by NIF. <br />It must be noted that while we make our best efforts to
          bring you the best Internship opportunities possible, Internalaya does
          not guarantee an Internship to a student.
        </p>
        <h3>Internship Application Terms</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you have applied for an Internship on Internalaya and receive a
              response from Internalaya or Employer regarding your application,
              you must respond to it within 72 hours.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Once you accept an Internship offer, you must make every possible
              effort to join and start the Internship on time. To not show up or
              to decline an earlier accepted Internship offer at the last
              moment, or to go incommunicado creates a very poor impression of
              you in front of the Employer and reduces the credibility of the
              Applicant community at large. Any such behaviour will not only
              result in your account being blocked on Internalaya but it will
              also be reported to your college administration wherever
              applicable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You must provide accurate and complete information at the time of
              Internship application or creating an account on Internalaya – any
              misrepresentation of information, or hiding of material
              information, or impersonation would result in your account being
              blocked on the site and you being reported to your college
              administration wherever applicable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You must pay attention to an Internship&#39;s complete details
              (profile, location, remuneration, skills required, etc.) before
              applying for it. Irrelevant applications will result in your
              account being penalized (we may stop you from applying to future
              Internships or block your account altogether.)

          </li>
          <li>

              You are strictly prohibited from transferring/selling/sharing
              Employers&#39; data (contact details etc.), for free or for a fee,
              with any other entity. Any such attempt would cause your account
              on Internalaya being permanently blocked and would result in legal
              action taken against you.

        <h2>Safety Tips for Applicants</h2>
        <p>
          It is our endeavor to provide all our users with a safe and
          hassle-free experience on Internalaya. Accordingly, we would like to
          make the Applicants aware of following safety tips for them.
        </p>
        <h3>Internalaya does NOT allow Employers to:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Offer unpaid internships, except for apprenticeships provisioned
              under Labour laws of Nepal,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Post training program and any such program where Applicants are
              expected to pay a security deposit or an admission fee,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Charge money in any form (including test fee, security deposit,
              documentation fee etc.) from the Applicants,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Offer Network Level Marketing (NLM) Internships where
              applicants/individuals have to use their personal connections and
              personal social media accounts to promote a business,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Offer any Internship where there is a possibility of an Applicant
              consuming alcohol or smoking or inducing others to do so,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Offer internships from individuals or organizations promoting
              explicit religious content, a particular religious personality or
              a sect etc,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Offer internship at businesses promoting or dealing in gambling,
              porn, and other prohibited/illegal/age-inappropriate activities,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Make third party Internship posting,</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Further, it is mandaory for Employers to ensure that:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Internship details communicated to Applicants at any stage are
              same as advertised on Internalaya and there is no negative
              material difference (E.g.-offering lower stipend than what was
              advertised on Internalaya or no stipend)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any assignment(s) that they may give to Applicants to assess their
              suitability for the Internship should be fair and relevant to the
              Internship profile. Any attempt to get work done for free from
              Applicants disguised as assessment or to get them to download or
              generate downloads for an app or get likes/shares/comments etc.
              for Employer&#39;s social media handles only for the purpose of
              getting free publicity disguised as an assignment are strictly
              prohibited.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              All their communications with Applicants (through Internalaya Chat
              or otherwise) are professional and must not contain any obscene or
              offensive content.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Once they hire any Applicant(s) for their Internship, they must
              provide them with an offer letter clearly detailing all the
              important details of the Internship (such as role &amp;
              responsibilities, remuneration, and payment mechanism) and
              complete address and contact details of Employer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              They pay the promised remuneration to the selected Applicant(s) in
              a timely manner as per agreed terms and conditions of the
              Internship as detailed in the offer letter.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you come across any example of any Employer violating these
          guidelines, you must report it to Internalaya using so that we can
          investigate and take appropriate actions.
