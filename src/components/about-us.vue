    <p class="text-justify text-lg pt-2">
      “Internalaya” as the name suggests is a platform of the interns for the
      interns and by the interns. The idea is to create a bridge between the gap
      that exists between "Bidhyalaya" (school/formal education) and "Karyalaya"
      (office/career/real-life work) by providing paid and purposeful
      internships to help youngsters explore the area of their interests and
      determine their career path. Internalaya seeks to become the first step
      towards a rewarding career and envisions to lay a solid foundation for
      every fresh graduate and career aspirant across Nepal by equipping them
      with relevant skills and practical exposure through internships and
      training.
